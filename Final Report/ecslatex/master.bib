abstract="This chapter presents the fundamental concepts of Tabu Search (TS) in a tutorial fashion. Special emphasis is put on showing the relationships with classical Local Search methods and on the basic elements of any TS heuristic, namely, the definition of the search space, the neighborhood structure, and the search memory. Other sections cover other important concepts such as search intensification and diversification and provide references to significant work on TS. Recent advances in TS are also briefly discussed.",
