The Lanchester Laws are a basic model of attrition developed in the First World War. Combat has changed since then with different arms on both sides being used in battles. The Lanchester dynamics can be extended to model these situations but that comes with another challenge. With multiple enemy arms to attack, what is the most efficient way of attacking the enemy in order to ensure as many of our troops survive the engagement. I intend on finding a general solution to this using by using numerical optimisation techniques on this simulation. Currently I have developed the simulation but need to develop the optimisation techniques to create optimal weights.
